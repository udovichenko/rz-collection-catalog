For a quarter of a century, my life has been inextricably linked to the work of the great composer Richard Wagner. I was in my early twenties when I first heard his mystery Parsifal. I tried for a long time to find an epithet for my feelings: the music simply struck me, and this would be perhaps the most accurate thing to say. I was also stunned by how close it was to me: the music captivated me completely and did not let go, it made my mind search for reasons of its fantastic appeal and power and reflect on its philosophical significance. Listening to this music gives me the feeling of eternity.
As my knowledge of Wagner’s masterpieces grew, so did my desire to understand why he had chosen a particular theme for a particular opera and what exactly he had sought to express with them. I began to share my thoughts with friends in short notes on opera performances, and as soon as I met like-minded people in the creative community, my inspiration began to take on a more substantial form, grow, and develop.
The artist Viktor Vasilyev is undoubtedly one of the brightest interpreters of the Wagnerian heritage in the fine arts. I well remember my first impressions of Viktor’s paintings presented in 2017 at an exhibition in St. Petersburg. The paintings were not just images of characters from Wagner’s operas that I knew well but, rather, were an immersion in the world of their feelings and experiences: Erda’s concern for the fate of her daughter, the valkyrie Brunnhilde; Waltraute’s sadness about the deplorable fate of her father, the supreme god Wotan; Brunnhilde’s happiness at the opportunity to save the world from the curse of the Nibelung’s ring; the unbridled passion of Tristan and Isolde. It was amazing: Viktor portrayed on canvas exactly the feelings that I wrote about in my notes! Two like-minded people could not help but get to know each other.
Since then, our strong “Wagnerian friendship”, conversations and correspondence about Wagner’s works have helped us with Viktor Vasilyev to complement each other creatively. Over the past years, I have written stories about Wagner’s life in Riga, St. Petersburg and Venice, and Viktor has brought these stories to canvas. Completing the set of paintings based on The Nibelung’s Ring and Parsifal, Viktor explained his emotional bonds with Wagner’s music as follows: “The specific feature of Wagner’s music, in my opinion, is its emotionality, for all its severity. I visualize it in cold colours: blue, grey, black, and gold, of course. Wagner’s music is congenial to me in terms of its ‘sound of colour’ if I can put it that way... My teacher, the St. Petersburg artist V. Lukka, once used the term ‘Baltic-German’ to describe my colour palette, and, as I understand, this unites me with Wagner, or either he is close to me. We see and feel the world in the same way…”
The creative dialogue and kindred spirit of the two artists inspired me to accompany each of Viktor’s works with a short text “What would Wagner say about Viktor Vasilyev’s paintings?” Our joint work was embodied in the Wagner Everywhere exhibition presented to the St Petersburg public and online in 2020.
I was delighted when we were joined by composer and pianist Anton Boldyrev who, along with such giants of pianism as Liszt, Tausig and von Bülow, has created his own paraphrases of Wagner’s music. “The idea of the paraphrase came to me after attending Parsifal in 2002,” Anton says. “The piano composer definitely ‘vanished’ inside Wagner, and I had to shorten the opera several times to create a 40-minute suite based on the opera’s leitmotivs. I worked with enthusiasm, so it was easy. As for the colour sensation, a lot depends on the tone. I feel close to Scriabin’s colour palette. In other words, for me, it is music with different shades of red. Like an orange-cap boletus!” Anton traditionally accompanies public presentations of Viktor’s new works.
The perceptional interpretation of Wagner’s masterpieces in colour, and in relation not only to a specific operatic work but also to “direct speech”, to quotes from his characters, inspires as much interest in the composer’s music as in the poetic text of librettos of his operas. The spectator thus naturally perceives the cultural synthesis of different types of art: music, painting and prose, which is exactly what Richard Wagner was striving for.
