“… the ripple effect is huge when something like this happens …” (Google.com)

It seems an almost impossible mission to describe a collector with the right words. And just what are they, art collectors? It has already been several years since I met Raivis Zabis, a businessman, art enthusiast and collector. If someone asked me how I would describe him as a collector, I would probably say that I don't know. I should mention, however, that art is something essential to Raivis and that it adds significant value to his life. His primary driving force seems to be his own curiosity: I would even name it a thirst for knowledge, and for a reason. Raivis knows how to see artists and their potential before others have noticed them. He has a gift to spot the artistic potential where institutions and curators haven't yet set foot. I might say that Raivis is more like a detective and a traveller, or even a 19th-century traveller who went on an expedition to find one thing, only to discover something else along the way.
Perhaps that is where we should start. A collector is formed, first and foremost, by his approach to art and the world in general, that is, how much he is attracted to the new, how much interested and involved he is in the artist’s creative process, when and how he follows it, and whether he supports it. Raivis' concept of collecting is inseparable from his idea of perceiving, creating and experiencing art.
He not only “collects” art pieces but also supports their creation by providing a place and a space at his artist residency near Liepāja, with the idea that it will expand as an incubator for art and culture in the coming years. As stated on the website of his collection, “When the purchase of artworks goes beyond accidental purchases and assumes a character of deliberate and more or less permanent activity, the process itself becomes a kind of art. The art of buying art.”
In my discussions with Raivis, I have noticed his increased interest in the art process, particularly in painting. However, he is not a blind follower of current trends in the art world, a visitor of biennials and art fairs or a buyer of uncommon artists’ works, but rather a careful and considered developer of his own taste. Perhaps the cultural environment of St Petersburg, where Raivis spent several years, was the starting point for his affair with art.
In the last decade, the collector’s role in the Latvian art scene has undeniably increased, and the art world has been dominated by several individuals who acquire contemporary art. While entrepreneur Janis Zuzāns, who purchased a number of works from the Candy Bomber exhibition of contemporary paintings in 2008, entered the art market in the late 2000s, several other local collectors, such as Maris Vitols, Vita Liberte, the Teterevs couple, and others, followed in his footsteps in recent years.
Notably, the collector in Latvia today preserves, in his own way, contemporary art for future generations, thereby filling a niche that should be served by a non-existent contemporary art museum. Although contemporary art is sporadically acquired by the Latvian National Museum of Art, the collector is able to buy it much more freely and often more effectively, to better respond to current trends, and to create exciting and original art combinations, sometimes even stepping into the shoes of a curator.
Obviously, this does not make an artistic act any less important, as Raivis pointed out in an interview. Collecting as a phenomenon, however, should also be viewed critically, given that collecting is ultimately a matter of a certain individual taste. Assembling a collection is based to a large extent on personal subjective criteria, so a collector cannot be expected to cover the entire art scene or be familiar with regular artistic practices. But since the collector is not isolated from the general ecosystem of the art world and is an essential participant in it, he also has a certain responsibility for the art process and, consequently, for the way how society consumes and perceives art.
Raivis keeps emphasising that his collection is largely based on his love for painting, a classical yet contemporary artistic medium that has been experiencing a renaissance in the last decade. According to art theorist Isabelle Graw, “… from the early modern period to the present, painting has been continuously associated with intellectual capacities: it has either been thought to display knowledge … or assumed to possess the power to do things and act.”
Since the historical avant-garde of the 20th century, painting as a medium has expanded its boundaries and has gone beyond plain painting on canvas that deals with exploring an object. In a broader sense, the definition of painting, along with the artistic process itself, should include the conceptual environment or the idea as well as its “agents”, that is, institutions, gallery owners, collectors, critics, and the like, who, apart from the artist himself, are also involved in the process.
The idea of the canvas as a plane has changed, as can be clearly seen, for example, in paintings by contemporary artist Katharina Grosse, whose work Raivis also greatly admires.
While Raivis sticks to the classical parameters of painting, with its language dominated by the presence of craftsmanship, emotional and sensual component, and figurativeness (multi-layered, but also abstract themes), his choice shows a desire to open up to broader experimentation with pictorial language, and a certain fascination with painting as a form.
“Visible brushstrokes and glossy oil paint can trigger a haptic longing to touch the painting’s surface ... this kind of haptic events can give rise to what I call ”vitalistic fantasies”: for example, the belief, going back to painting theorists in antiquity, that paintings bear some resemblance to their creators. Despite actually being absent, the artist is imagined into the picture she or he has created and seems to maintain a ghostly presence within the work.”
This idea can be related to Raivis’ approach of staying in close (even constant) contact with the artists whose work is included in his collection. Such communication, discussion and knowledge of artistic practice seem to add value to artworks in the collection. Everything is complemented by Raivis’ belief in the artist’s growth and career progression. This is something that can be described as a potential investment in the future with a certain risk premium.
Painting for Raivis is like an intellectual exercise that is exciting to engage in, exploring the relations of this medium with both the historical and the contemporary. Below I will review a selection of works by some Latvian artists from the RZ Collection, looking at how their identities and aesthetic views form a mutual connection, and how they fit into the current processes of contemporary Latvian painting.
The RZ Collection features artists from different generations. Many of them are not the most prominent figures on the contemporary art scene. It says a lot about Raivis’ aesthetic taste as a collector: he is not so much focused on contemporary art trends, but rather prefers a broader perspective and pays attention to marginal names too, for example, Dace Dēliņa Lipska with her vivid images of Suiti women or Aldis Donenbergs who specialises in expressive images of birds. You won’t find these artists at contemporary art exhibitions in Riga; their work is most commonly seen at local art museums in Liepāja or Valmiera.
Even so, Raivis has noticed and highly appreciated the work of these artists, no matter that they follow the values of classical painting with the emphasis on the effective pictorial image. In a similar way, Kaspars Perskis uses the language of academic painting. However, his work, like the Mannerist experiments of Atis Jakobsons who explored the ideal beauty, attracts by a cultivated form that appeals to the viewer with the free expression of brushstrokes and romantic images.
Daiga Kruse, whose pictorial vision with its purity, dynamic colour relations and inner paradoxes is highly regarded by the local school of painting, also creates this kind of ideal imaginary landscape.
Sandra Strehle, a younger generation artist, addresses similar landscape themes too, but her paintings lack Daiga’s fluidity and intuitive emotionality. Sandra rather focuses on schematic architectural landscapes where the scene is structured and organised to an extent that sometimes it may look like an image from a design magazine.
The collection also features works by Lauris Ozols and Klāvs Loris. These young artists, although fairly new to painting, show interesting qualities of pictorial language: the ability to go beyond the mainstream academic school of painting and address new challenges. Their presence in the collection shows that Raivis likes to broaden his horizons in painting by actively following the latest trends and including those names that are still at the beginning of their artistic career.
Raivis' collection is not homogeneous and is constantly evolving; his artistic choices are often contrasting and full of paradoxes. This is his signature collecting approach and style.
